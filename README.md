# Members Only! (Node.js Edition)

## In a nutshell

A web application where users are able to create posts/stories. Other users won't be able to see the author, unless they are a member. To become a member, one must redeem a secret code to the site. Currently unstyled.

## Project objective

The main purpose of this project was for me to practice working with Node ([Express](https://expressjs.com/)), namely user-authentication ([Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/)).
